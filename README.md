# Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description 

### Develop a Work Day Scheduler that satisties the following  acceptable criteria:
1. Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
2. Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
3. Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
4. Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.
5. Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
6. Persist events between refreshes of a page
7. The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

### Motivation 

1. Time Management: A scheduler helps you allocate time for different tasks, ensuring that you make the most of your work hours. It allows you to prioritize and organize your activities efficiently.
2. Increased Productivity: With a well-organized schedule, you can enhance your productivity by focusing on tasks at hand and avoiding procrastination. Setting specific time blocks for each activity helps maintain a disciplined work routine.
3. Task Prioritization: A scheduler allows you to prioritize tasks based on their importance and deadlines. This ensures that critical tasks are completed on time and prevents the feeling of being overwhelmed by a long to-do list.
4. Goal Achievement: Breaking down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks and scheduling them throughout the day helps you make progress consistently. This can lead to a greater sense of accomplishment as you achieve your daily and long-term objectives.
5. Reduced Stress: Knowing what tasks you need to accomplish and having a plan in place can reduce stress and anxiety associated with uncertainty. It provides a clear roadmap for your day, making it easier to navigate through your responsibilities.
6. Time for Personal Development: A scheduler allows you to allocate time for self-improvement activities, such as learning new skills, exercising, or pursuing hobbies. This balance between work and personal development contributes to a more fulfilling life.
7. Improved Work-Life Balance: By structuring your workday effectively, you can create a better balance between work and personal life. This can lead to increased satisfaction and well-being.
8. Adaptability: Schedulers can be adjusted as priorities change or unexpected tasks arise. This adaptability ensures that you remain flexible and responsive to evolving work demands.
9. Consistency and Habits: Using a scheduler encourages the development of consistent daily routines and habits. Over time, these habits become ingrained, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness in your work.

## Usage

1. Open HTML File:
Save the HTML code in an HTML file, for example, index.html.
Open the HTML file in a web browser.
2. View and Edit the Schedule:
The scheduler displays time slots from 9 AM to 5 PM.
Each time slot has an input field for entering tasks and a "Save" button to store the task in local storage.
3. Enter and Save Tasks:
Type your tasks into the input fields corresponding to each time slot.
Click the "Save" button next to the input field to save the task in local storage.
4. Color Coding:
The time blocks are color-coded based on the current time:
Pastel pink: Past hours
Pink: Current hour
Dark pink: Future hours
5. Retrieve and Update Data:
The scheduler retrieves and displays previously saved tasks from local storage when you open the page.
6. Automatic Updates:
The current time and color coding are automatically updated every minute.
